http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/dev-geoiptools-v0-1-api-for-lookups-in-the-maxmind-geoip-database-1000.27620/

### HSQLDB ###
To use the HSQL database download http://stuff.whoami.org.uk/hsqldb/hsqldb.jar.
Create a "lib" directory in your server root and copy the downloaded file to
that directory. Open the config.yml in plugins/EasyBan/ and replace 
"database: yaml" with database: hsql

### MySQL ###
To use MySQL as data backend download <http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/>.
In that zip archive is a "mysql-connector-java-${VERSION}-bin.jar" file. Rename
that file to "mysql-connector-java-bin.jar" and move it to the "lib" directory
in your craftbukkit root folder. When the "lib" folder doesn't exist create it.
Now create a database with the name "easyban" in mysql. Open the config.yml in 
plugins/EasyBan/ and replace "database: yaml" with "database: mysql". Additionally
you have to add these 4 settings:

host: 'XYZ'  # MySQL Server address
port: 'XYZ'  # MySQL Server port
username: 'XYZ' # MySQL user
password: 'XYZ' # password for that user

### Custom messages ###
After the first start you'll find a messages.yml in "plugins/EasyBan/". To edit
a message just change the part right of the ":".
